This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase, containing specifically included files and files not matching ignore patterns, combined into a single document by Repomix.
The content has been processed where content has been compressed (code blocks are separated by ⋮---- delimiter).

# File Summary

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of a subset of the repository's contents that is considered the most important context.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Only files matching these patterns are included: **/*.{py,js,mjs,cjs,ts,tsx,jsx,java,kt,kts,gd,groovy,gradle,toml,json,yaml,yml,sql,sh}
- Files matching these patterns are excluded: .ai/**, **/node_modules/**, **/.gradle/**, **/build/**, **/dist/**, **/.venv/**, **/__pycache__/**, **/.pytest_cache/**, **/.git/**, **/coverage/**, **/*.lock, **/*.min.js, **/*.map, assets/**, art/**, art_sources/**, marketing/**, colab/**, kaggle/**, discovery-cache.json, health-snapshot.json, history.json
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Content has been compressed - code blocks are separated by ⋮---- delimiter
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)
